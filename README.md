# Eating Burgers with Express Handlebars

## Description
    
Full stack dining! This project utilizes the front-end NPM package of Express Handlebars with the back-end packages of Express and MySQL databases. This application also represents my first foray into the model-view-controller development model. Though simplistic, I have developed the project to follow an MVC style, making the steps and flow of information easier to follow. From a client's point of view, everything is smooth and simple. Looking at it from the developer's side, this project follows guidelines that allows us to organize code in a way that makes it easy to debug or add additional functionality.

This application is deployed on [Heroku](https://blooming-peak-41927.herokuapp.com/).
    
## Usage

Adding a burger will store it in the database for persistent storage so that you can come back at any time to devour it. Once devoured, the devoured burger list and the MySQL database will be updated. Check it out [here](https://blooming-peak-41927.herokuapp.com/)!
